									<p><strong>What are machine learning and data science?</strong> </p>
									<p> Let me give you an example to illustrate what that means! Say you are interested in implementing a spam filter. The probably most conservative approach would be to let a person sort these emails manually. Now, the “traditional” programming approach would be to look at some example emails (and/or use your “domain knowledge”) to come up with a chain of rules like

										“if this email contains word X, label it as spam, else if email contains …”
										
										Now, machine learning algorithms help you formulating these rules. Or in other words, (supervised) machine 
										learning algorithms will look at a dataset of labeled emails (spam and non-spam) and derive rules from there 
										to separate the two classes.</p>
									<p><strong>How do I know if the problem is solvable through machine learning?</strong><br><br> In general, most ML algorithm assume that our training samples are i.i.d. Since we want your training set to be representative of the population, we need to divide it into training and test sets randomly.

										Also, we want to use our test set only once; we don’t want retrain your model 
										and evaluate it on the random test set over and over again, or our estimate will be hugely overoptimistic otherwise. We should use k-fold cross-validation or nested cross-validation instead.
									</p>
									<p><strong>How important do you think having a mentor is to the learning process?</strong><br><br>I guess it really depends on what type of learner you are.
										From what I understand, a mentor is like a “personal trainer,” someone who gives you homework, tells you what books to read, etc. (in contrast to a teacher or professor who teaches a whole class at once). I think it is important to have friends who share similar interests to bounce of ideas, and I think it is important to know someone more knowledgeable than you who you could ask questions for your personal growth (e.g., a Prof who supervises your Ph.D. thesis would be such a person). However, I am not sure how important a “mentor” is for technical questions – I think that’s the 1-person equivalent of an answer poll via cross-validated or Quora. Anyways, I think a mentor may be a nice thing to have for certain people, 
										but I wouldn’t say everyone needs a dedicated “mentor.”
